When I applied for postdoc positions, I had to go through several resources to prepare my application and for interview. I created a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QyoYoTHRDnZkvOnQyiNHJFbBZZAJQuz0eGRmFUaH_74/edit?usp=sharing) based on my interview experience. If you're a prospective postdoc applicant, you may find this helpful. Good luck!
