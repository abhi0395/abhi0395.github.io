Thanks for your interest in knowing more about me...

First, I'll start with my name. Abhijeet means "victorious" in Hindi and Sanskrit. It is also the Sanskrit name for [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega). My native village is in [West Champaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaran), [Bihar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar), India ( Fun fact: the same district where [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) started the final phase of the [Indian independence movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement) and acclaimed writer [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) was born). I grew up in [Bettiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bettiah) and [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna) (the capital city of Bihar and also one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_continuously_inhabited_cities#Central_and_South_Asia)), where I finished my schooling at [St. Xavier's High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Xavier%27s_High_School,_Patna) (up to class 10th) and [DAV Public School](http://davbsebpatna.org/) (for 10+2). Bihar is also the [land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya) of [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) and the greatest empire India had in the past, the [Maurya Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire) The ancient city of [Vaishali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishali_%28ancient_city%29) of Bihar is considered one of the first examples of democratic republics in the world. The place prides in it's heritage, such as [Nalanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda), the center of ancient Vedic tradition.
