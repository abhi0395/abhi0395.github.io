## About me

My name is Abhijeet Anand (Hindi: अभिजीत आनंद, pronounced as UH-B-h-ee-J-EE-T aa-nun-d). I am from [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), India. I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory), working with the [Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) team. Previously, I was also a bridge postdoc at [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA)](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/) in Garching, Germany. Before that, I was an [IMPRS](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/) PhD student at MPA Garching, Germany. I graduated with PhD in Astrophysics from the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich) in Jul 2022. I completed my BS-MS in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science) in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), in July 2017. I also worked as a [Junior Research Fellow (JRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Research_Fellowship) at the [National Institute of Advanced Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Advanced_Studies), Bangalore from Sep 2017 to Jul 2018.

## Looking for short projects

If you're a local undergrad (in the Bay Area) looking for short-term projects, have a look at my [research](/research) and if interests you, feel free to write to me with your interests, availability and level of programming. I have a few projects in mind and would be happy to discuss with you. 

<!-- My research was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Guinevere Kauffmann](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galaxyformation) and [Dr. Dylan Nelson](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/%7Ednelson/).  -->
