## About me

My name is Abhijeet Anand (Hindi: अभिजीत आनंद, pronounced as *UH-B-h-ee-J-EE-T aa-nun-d*).  
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scientist at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory), working with the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) team. I received my PhD in Astrophysics in July 2022 as an [IMPRS PhD Fellow](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/student-class-2018-2021.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA)](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/), with my degree awarded by the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich). I later continued at MPA as a Bridge Postdoctoral Fellow before moving to Berkeley Lab. 

Earlier, I completed my BS-MS in Physics at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science), [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), in July 2017. From September 2017 to July 2018, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at the [National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Advanced_Studies), Bangalore.  

I am originally from [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), India. You can find more about me [here](/pages/detailabout).
