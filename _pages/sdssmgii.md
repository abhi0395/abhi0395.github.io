I developed an automated absorber detection pipeline using a matched kernel convolution technique and adaptive S/N criteria. The pipeline can run parallelly on several quasars at once to reduce the absorber search time. The detection algorithm was run on all quasars from SDSS DR16 and compiled the largest [MgII / FeII catalogue](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/MgII/) available to date, which included ~160,000 systems. If you're interested in using the catalogue for CGM-absorber cross-correlation studies feel free to use the catalogue.
